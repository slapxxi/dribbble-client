# Navigation

Navigation is used with a tab interface that allows to launch actions on taps.

Navigation provides an ability to switch between three types of projects. After pressing a navigation item, users is provided with shots of the particular type. For instance, when a user presses on the “Popular” tab, we load and show the popular shots.

## Interaction

An active item is visually distinguished from a passive item in the navigation to make it easier for users to understand where they’re now.

When users scrolls in the list below navigation, the navigation component is shrinked to make more space available for better content consumption.
